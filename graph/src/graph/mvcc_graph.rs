//! Multi-Version Concurrency Control for graph access.
//!
//! This module provides [`MvccGraph`], the top-level coordinator for concurrent
//! graph access. It ensures:
//!
//! - Multiple readers can access the graph simultaneously
//! - Only one writer at a time (serialized writes)
//! - Writers work on a versioned copy, committing atomically
//!
//! ## Concurrency Model
//!
//! ```text
//! MvccGraph
//!    ├── graph: Arc<AtomicRefCell<Graph>>  (current committed version)
//!    └── write: AtomicBool  (write lock)
//!
//! read()  → Clone Arc (readers see committed state)
//! write() → Create new version (if lock acquired)
//! commit() → Swap graph pointer, release lock
//! rollback() → Discard version, release lock
//! ```
//!
//! ## Good Practice: Lock-Free Reads
//!
//! Readers never block - they simply clone the Arc to the current graph.
//! The atomic bool only serializes write acquisition, not read access.
